# Phishing Email Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Phishing emails are fraudulent messages designed to steal sensitive
information such as passwords, bank details, and personal data.
This project uses machine learning techniques to automatically
detect phishing emails and classify them as phishing or legitimate.

## Objectives

- Improve email security
- Reduce fraud and cyber attacks

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Dataset
The dataset consists of email messages labeled as phishing or legitimate.
Text data is preprocessed and converted into numerical features using
TF-IDF vectorization.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Prediction

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## Output
- Email classified as Phishing or Legitimate
- Accuracy and performance metrics

## Conclusion
This system helps in identifying phishing emails effectively and
enhances email security using machine learning techniques.
